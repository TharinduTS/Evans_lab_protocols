# ExoSapping

### Mix per sample

Band Intensity | Medium | light | No band
-------------- |:------:| :----:| -------
Exo1 | 0.125 | 0.125 | 0.125
FastAP | 1 | 1 | 1
ddH2O | 4 | 2 | 1

### Medium vs light band
- medium band: when you are certain a band is present  
- light band: very fade, can tell there is something but not very sure
- no band: can not see a band at all

1. determine how many of medium/light/no band that you want to send for sequencing.
  - ex, 10 medium bands, 5 light bands 
2. take a 1.7ml tube and label it with the intensity
  -  label 1 tube medium and 1 tube light
3. calculate the amount of regents that you need for each intensity based on the mix per sample table above
    Band Intensity | Medium |Medium x11| light | light x 6
    -------------- |:------:|:--------:|:-----:| -------
    Exo1 | 0.125 | 0.125 | 0.125
    FastAP | 1 | 1 | 1
    ddH2O | 4 | 2 | 1
