# Designing Primers
Primer design guideline: 
-  primer length: 18-24
- melting temperature (Tm): 50-60°C, within 5°C of each other. If the Tm of your primer is very low, try to find a sequence with more GC content, or extend the length of the primer a little.
- GC content: around 50% (40-60%), start and end with one G/C to promote stability
- Ending (3') in a G or C will give it a better bonding force. 
- Try to avoid regions of secondary structure, and have a balanced distribution of GC-rich and AT-rich domains.
- Try to avoid runs of 4 or more of one base, or dinucleotide repeats (for example, ACCCC or ATATATAT).
- Avoid intra-primer homology (more than 3 bases that complement within the primer) or inter-primer homology (forward and reverse primers having complementary sequences).  These circumstances can lead to self-dimers or primer-dimers instead of annealing to the desired DNA sequences.



# This is how we order primers

Primers are ordered from this website 'https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/pc/ui/tube-home/standard'. Login with lab account and password. Their website might change once in a while (below are instruction writen based on current website on Oct 2017). 

1. To get to primer ordering page, select taps following this path: product -> Custome Product -> Order Oliges and Peptides -> Oligos and Probes -> DNA Oligos in Tubes -> Order. 
2. If you have the primer information entered in a Multiple Entry Template(provided by Sigma, including columns: *Oligo Name	Sequence	Scale (μmole)	"Notes (Optional)"*), choose "upload and copy & paste".If you dont, select "manual entry". 4 essential components:
    - oligo name: select a name for the primer that make sense for your (ex, nr5a1_ex1_for1, nr5a1 is the name of gene the primer is for, ex1 indicate exon1 of the gene, for1 indicate forward primer 1). 
    - seqenuence(5' to 3'): the input primer sequence need to start from the 5' to 3' of the primer (not the 5' to 3' of the sequence that you are trying to amplify)
    - scale (umole): 0.025
    - purification: Desalt
    - notes: RP1
3. The primers will be in the form of dry powder and will be in a tube. Shipping time is about 2-3 days. 

# This is how we make a 100um stock of primers once they arrive
1. Before making the stock, centrifigute the tube containing primers for 2min at 8.0rpm to allow the primers (in powder) to aggragate at the bottom of the tube. 
2. On the Technical Datasheet that arrives with the primers, the second last column (ul for 100uM) indicated the amount of distilled water(in ul) that you need to add in order to reach primer concentration of 100uM. To avoid contamination, use the 1000ul pipete tips with filter (100ul pipete tips with a filter dis near the top). You can add the distilled water directly into the tube containing the primers. 


# This is how we make a 20uM stock of primers from the 100uM stock
1. Take a new 1.5ml tube from the pre-PCR drawer, label the tube with the name of the primer. 
2. Take 40ul of above primer stock and mix it with 160ul distilled water.
